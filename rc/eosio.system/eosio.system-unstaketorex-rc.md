# Action - `unstaketorex`

## Description

The `unstaketorex` action allows an account to buy REX using EOS tokens which are currently staked for either CPU or Network bandwidth.

As an authorized party I, {{ signer }}, wish to buy REX tokens by unstaking {{ from_cpu }} EOS from CPU bandwidth and {{ from_net }} EOS from Network bandwidth from account {{ owner }} that are staked to account {{ receiver }}.

I am aware of, and have fulfilled, all voting requirements needed to participate in the REX marketplace.
