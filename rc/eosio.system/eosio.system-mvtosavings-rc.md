# Action - `mvtosavings`

## Description

The `mvtosavings` action allows an account to move REX tokens into a savings bucket.

As an authorized party I, {{ signer }}, wish to move {{ rex }} tokens to a savings bucket associated to the account {{ owner }}. I acknowledge that those tokens will then be subject to any maturity restrictions described in the `mvfrsavings` action.
