# Action - `closerex`

## Description

As an authorized party, I {{ signer }}, wish to delete all unused REX-related database entries from the account {{ owner }}.

I will not be able to succesfully call `closerex` unless all checks for CPU loans, NET loans or refunds pending refunds are still processing on the account {{ owner }}.
